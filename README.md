# ryanfurrer-v5

At the date of writing, this is the latest and greatest version of my portfolio yet. Like [ryanfurrer-v4](https://github.com/ryanfurrer/ryanfurrer-v4), I learned _so much_ while building this site. A few things I learned with this project were:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Working with a CMS, [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) and APIs
  Like the previous two versions of my portfolio, I expanded my knowledge of JavaScript, SEO, and so much more as mentioned above. I truly enjoyed building this site and am now obsessed with Astro. I also finally am fully hosting my own blog on my own website. This gives me most control over it and I am thrilled to have become more confident with integrating a CMS and using an API to pull that information.
